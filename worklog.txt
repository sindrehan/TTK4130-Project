WORK LOG

*Changes inn assignment descriptions (05.04.18): Task 3 divided into tasks 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Feedback from student assistant:

- One of our resulting values is very high, check if units are correct.
- We must run a new 100-day simulation every time we change a parameter in task 3 (now tasks 5 and 6).


(05.04.18)
-----------
Goal: Redo of task 5 and 6 (previously task 3 b,c and d). Now have to do a new 100 day simulation for every change in parameter.

Mostly stuck on getting the right Kla value of 84/d in tank5 on task 5 (as specified in section 4 of BSM1). 
Setting Kla as a parameter in tank5 gives singularity error. The error propagates into the AE and ME sensors.

Important take-away from this session: the data from combiTable has to be implemented in WWSource to be taken into account!


(10.04.18)
-----------
Goal: Fix issues with Kla and finish tasks 5 and 6.

Fixed issue with Kla. Problem was: had to change So back to a variable when Kla was changed back to a constant to maintain the
same degrees of freedom as before (error messages was useless here).

New issue with strange reaults from 14-day open-loop sensitivity analysis: none of the indicators reach a fixed value, but decrease
or increase continuously. We were not able to solve this, so we decided to move on with the faulty model, as recommended by student
assistant.

As it turned out (for some unknown reason) the results were better when the exact same simulations were run on Carita's computer 
instead of the school computers. Student assistant could confirm that Carita's results looked familiar. So tasks 5 and 6 were done 
on her computer while Ivan and Thomas continued with tasks 5 and 6 on the school computers.
