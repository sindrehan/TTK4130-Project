WORK LOG

*Changes inn assignment descriptions (05.04.18): Task 3 divided into tasks 3, 4, 5 and 6.

Feedback from student assistant:

- One of our resulting values is very high, check if units are correct.
- We must run a new 100-day simulation every time we change a parameter in task 3 (now tasks 5 and 6).


(05.04.18)
-----------
Goal: Redo of task 5 and 6 (previously task 3 b,c and d). Now have to do a new 100 day simulation for every change in parameter.

Mostly stuck on getting the right Kla value of 84/d in tank5 on task 5 (as specified in section 4 of BSM1). 
Setting Kla as a parameter in tank5 gives singularity error. The error propagates into the AE and ME sensors.

Important take-away from this session: the data from combiTable has to be implemented in WWSource to be taken into account!


(10.04.18)
-----------
Goal: Fix issues with Kla and finish tasks 5 and 6.

Fixed issue with Kla. Problem was: had to change So back to a variable when Kla was changed back to a constant to maintain the
same degrees of freedom as before (error messages was useless here).

New issue with strange reaults from 14-day open-loop sensitivity analysis: none of the indicators reach a fixed value, but decrease
or increase continuously. We were not able to solve this, so we decided to move on with the faulty model, as recommended by student
assistant.

As it turned out (for some unknown reason) the results were better when the exact same simulations were run on Carita's computer 
instead of the school computers. Student assistant could confirm that Carita's results looked familiar. So tasks 5 and 6 were done 
on her computer while Ivan and Thomas continued with tasks 5 and 6 on the school computers. 

We made the "perfect settler" on the school computers, but decided to test it on Carita's computer to get valid results.

- Remaining of task 9: Make a copy of the original BenchPlant and insert the new settler. Use settle_initial.mos as initialization
script and run for a 100 days to reach steady-state.

- Next time: finish task 9 and task 10.

Goal: Complete task 5 (again) event though results are wrong. Complete task 10.

Task 5a: 
- Reduced volumetric flow in Q_a (RecyclePump) by 30% and ran open-loop assessment.
- Reduced volumetric flow rate in Q_r (ReturnPump) by 30% and ran open-loop assessment.

Task 5b:
- Reduced Y_H by 40% and ran open-loop assessment.
- Increased Y_H by 40% and ran open-loop assessment.
- Reduced Y_A by 40% and ran open-loop assessment.
- Increased Y_A by 40% and ran open-loop assessment.

(23.04.2018)
-------------
Goal: Complete task 5, adding figures and analysis to report.

Done!

Note: Carita should add units to the figures in task 6.

Ramaining work: 
- Write theory section
- Edit conclusion
- Write short about activated sludge model in introduction (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sewage_treatment#Pretreatment)
- Look over report.
