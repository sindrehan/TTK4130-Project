\section*{Assignment 1 (Implementation of wastewater treatment plant model)}\label{sec:Assignment1}
%This assignment was about downloading and familiarize ourselves with the wastewater treatment package
The ASM1 BenchPlant example in WasteWater treatment package for Dymola by Gerald Reichl, \cite{wastewater}, was downloaded and simulated with initial values found in \ref{sec:AppendixC}. By use of ASM1 a simulation model for BSM1 open loop was made by implementation of the following adjustments:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Feedback controllers deleted
    \item Stoichiometry parameters changed to match those in Table 3 of BSM1 report, \cite{alex2008}.
    \item Aeration equation in aeartion tanks "nitri" where set to 
    \begin{equation}
        aeration=K_La(So_{sat}-So)
    \end{equation}
    Where the saturation concentration for oxygen is $So_{sat}=\unit[8]{gm^{-3}}$. As given in section 2.3.2 of BSM1 report.
    \item Volume and Kla values changed to mach those given in section 2.3.1 and 4 of BSM1 report.
    \item Pump flowrates, $Q_a$ and $Q_w$, altered to mach those in section 2.1 and 4. $Q_r$ set to $\unit[18446]{m^3/d}$, given in project description.   
    \item Blower deleted
    \item Temperature inputs deleted
\end{itemize}
A figure of BSM1 Open-loop Dymola Implementation can be found in \ref{fig:openloop}. The open loop configuration has constant source and pump inputs, the system shall therefore reach steady state after some time, as can be seen i our results at this stage.
