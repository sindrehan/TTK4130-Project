(Multiple-input, Multiple-output control system design pairing)
Systems with more than one manipulated variable and controlled variable are referred to as ”MultipleInput,
Multiple-Output” systems, often abbreviated as ”MIMO”. For nearly all important processes
there are two controlled variables, e.g. product throughput and quality. An added complexity of
MIMO systems is the fact that process interactions are present, i.e. each manipulated variable may
affect both controlled variables. In the presence of significant interactions the choice of the most
suitable manipulated variables is not obvious.

(a) Determine the steady-state gain matrix by incurring small perturbations on the manipulated variables
and calculating the changes in the controlled variable. The steady-state gain matrix can be
used to evaluate the interactions of the different manipulated variables on the controlled variables.

(b) Use Bristols relative gain array method (RGA) to systematically choose the manipulated variables
to control the nitrate content after tank2 and the oxygen content after tank5. RGA is one of many
methods to make this decision.
